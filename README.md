# Python-Hangman
This is my hangman game in python. The goal is to guess the word by suggesting letters, one at a time. For every incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure (the hangman) is drawn. You have six chances to guess wrong before the game ends. If you guess all the letters correctly before you run out of guesses, you win :3
